# rigidbody vs Transform movement in Unity 2D
[![Tutorial Sectiont 1](http://img.youtube.com/vi/UA2F8s3fCLs/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UA2F8s3fCLs)

<p>  Learn thge difference between Transform based movement and Rigidbody based movement.
 
 For a long time I didn't understand the difference between Transform and Physics system in Unity. Actually they both interact with each other. The problem is that Collider and collision detection will only react to RigidBody based movement. 
 
 That is what I want to explain so you will never again ask yourself / forum " WHy is my collison detection not working?!"
 
 I hope you will find it useful :)
